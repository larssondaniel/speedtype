As of now we've got a working background track.

A discussion on how the configurations from the new settings system should be utilized were had. We also discussed how we wanted to load words into the existing dictionary and wether or not we should have a editable "master"-database stored externally.

	* Outcomes and assignments (5 min)
Olle will finish up the falling words game mode and start working on a better way to listen to keyboard inputs. If time allows he will also do some research on external storage for the dictionary. David and Daniel will continue working on the "Balance" game mode which have been stalled for some time now. Robin will continue working on the seemingly endless task of testing.
